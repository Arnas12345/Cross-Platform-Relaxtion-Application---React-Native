This was my Final Year Project. This project consisted of creating an application using React Native. The application was to support a long-term health condition
being mental health. ZenZone is used to help users reduce and lower their stress and anxiety through a number of different features.

To run this project, you must have Expo, Node.JS and React Native installed on your computer.
To run a development server, you need to run npm start on the command line.
